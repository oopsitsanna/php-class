<h2>CISW410 - Spring2019 | Anna O.  | Independent Project I</h2>
<h1 style="font-size:38px;color:grey;">Lab Exercises</h1>
<br>
<h2 id="LP1">Chapter 1-2 | Lab Project 1 | Exercise 
1-1, 1-2, 1-3, <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch02_ex1/display_discount.php" target="_blank">2-1, </a>
<a href="../ch02_ex2/display_results.php" target="_blank"> 2-2</a>.</h2>
<p>The first chapter’s lab exercises give the sense of  how to work with the textbook and run application. Also, it explains how HTML, CSS and PHP work together; how to work with code in text editor or NetBeans. I was able to start and run Product Discount Application (Exercise 1-1) and run some of the book applications and some of the exercise applications (Exercise 1-2). In Exercise 1-3 I checked out how to work with NetBeans, how to open files in this program, what is the file system there and how this program point in syntax errors.<br>
In Chapter 2 I learned how to embed PHP in HTML; how to code statements and comments; what data types provides PHP; how to declare variables; how to get data from request; how to modify, validate and display data on the web page. In addition, I was introduced how to pass control to another web page (include or require functions). In <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch02_ex1/display_discount.php" target="_blank">Exercise 2-1</a> I added filter_input() function to get data from the form; calculated the discount and discounted price; applied currency formatting to the dollar and percent amounts; and fixed the heading for the file. In the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch02_ex2/display_results.php" target="_blank">Exercise 2-2</a> I enhanced the validity checking so it tests the interest rate entry using relational operators and modified current date using date() function.</p>
<!-- ************************* 3 - 4 ******************************* -->
<h2 id="LP2">Chapter 3-4 | Lab Project 2 | Exercise 3-1,  
<a href="../ch04_ex1/category_list.php" target="_blank">4-1</a>.</h2>
<p> Objective of the lab is using phpMyAdmin with a database. I learned how to use SQL statements to retrieve/display data from the tables. In the chapter exercise I was able to switch users in phpMyAdmin and run scripts to form tables in some criterias, add and delete rows in the tables.<br>
In Chapter 4 I learned how to create an object and handle exceptions or errors using try/catch statement; how to get and modify date. In the lab assignment Exercise 4-1 I added to the file <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch04_ex1/category_list.php" target="_blank">category_list.php</a> code that creates the category table using POST method to call the delete_category.php file, and using hidden fields to pass variables to this file. Then, I wrote the code that lets the user add a category to the database linked it to add_category.php file. To add or delete data to the form by creating two separate documents <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch04_ex1/add_category.php" target="_blank">add_category.php</a> and 
<a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch04_ex1/delete_category.php" target="_blank">delete_category.php</a> to make code manageable. </p>

<!-- ************************* 5 - 6 ******************************* -->
<h2 id="LP3">Chapter 5-6 | Lab Project 3 | Exercise 5-1, <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch06_ex1/display_results.php" target="_blank">6-1</a>, 6-2, 6-3.</h2>
<p>Consider a best programming practice and to escape cumbersome scripts/applications I was discover how to use MVC pattern; break the code on function that help maintain and organize scripts; how to redirect the request to another URL and how to navigate in directory. In Exercise 5-1 I enhanced the Guitar Shop application. In the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch05_ex1/product_manager/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a> file I added an action that displays the Category List page. In the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch05_ex1/product_manager/category_list.php" target="_blank">category_list.php</a> file I created the category table similar to Exercise 4-1 and added category/submit button that lets the users add data to database. For the other directory I created code to add and delete categories in the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch05_ex1/model/category_db.php" target="_blank">category_db.php</a> file using two functions called add_category() and delete_category(). Then, I made refactoring the Product Catalog app by creating a new <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch05_ex1/view/categories_nav.php" target="_blank"> categories_nav.php</a> file and editing code for the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch05_ex1/product_manager/product_list.php" target="_blank">product_list.php</a> and <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch05_ex1/product_catalog/product_view.php" target="_blank">product_view.php</a> in product_catalog directory.
<br>
To correct any problems that might perform application Chapter 6 introduces how to debug an application. Thus, we can use text editor (with echo statement), browser, or NetBeans/Xdebug. In <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch06_ex1/display_results.php" target="_blank">Exercise 6-1</a> I used echo statement to trace the execution of the Future Value app. It can display the values of variable, so it is a good opportunity to catch logic errors in the code.</p>

<!-- ************************* 7 ******************************* -->
<h2 id="LP4">Chapter 7 | Lab Project 4 | Exercise <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch07_ex1/display_results.php" target="_blank">7-1</a>, <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch07_ex2/index.php" target="_blank">7-2</a>.</h2>
<p>In this chapter I learned more about getting input from the user and displaying output on a web page. In <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch07_ex1/display_results.php" target="_blank">Exercise 7-1</a> I wrote the PHP code that gets input form a form and displays output on the screen. For the radio button and check box fields I coded default values, and for the text field I added code that convert special characters into HTML entities and coded new line if its needed. In <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch07_ex2/index.php" target="_blank">Exercise 7-2</a> the Future Value application I coded drop-down list instead of text boxes. Also, I used for loop to fill drop-down list.</p>

<!-- ************************* 8 - 9 ******************************* -->
<h2 id="LP5">Chapter 8-9 | Lab Project 5 | Exercise <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch08_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">8-1</a>, 8-2, <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch09_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">9-1</a>, <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch09_ex2/index.php" target="_blank">9-2</a>.</h2>
<p>In Chapter 8 I learned more about coding control statements like if, while, for statement. I had a chance to see how to use nested loops - if statement and switch statement. In <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch08_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">Exercise 8-1</a> I used switch statement to determine the discount percent. Also, users can enter lowercase or uppercase letter for the customer type. 
In Exercise 8-2 in the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch08_ex2/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a> file I modified loops to calculate total and average for the Loop Tester application. I also changed if statements to for loop to make code easy to manage in the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch08_ex2/loop_tester.php" target="_blank">loop_tester.php</a> file. <br>
How to work with numbers and strings and how to format them I learned In Chapter 9. I applied new knowledge in <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch09_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">Exercise 9-1</a> in application that uses code that process the data entered by the user. The code validates user’s entry and format it before displaying on the web page.  In <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch09_ex2/index.php" target="_blank">Exercise 9-2</a> I was practicing work with numbers. In application its data displayed neat and all calculations were done in PHP file.</p>

<!-- ************************* 10 ******************************* -->
<h2 id="LP6">Chapter 10 | Lab Project 6 | Exercise <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch10_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">10-1</a>.</h2>
<p>In Chapter 10 I learned how to work with dates and times in PHP applying the object-oriented approach. In <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch10_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">Exercise 10</a> I learned how to process the data that are entered into the text boxes. In this application I modified code so it’s valuate entry with POST method, then process data using switch statement, so set default invoice date one month prior to current date and set default due date two months after current date using DateInterval() and DateTime() functions. Then, the app checks user’s entry and converts date strings to DateTime objects and uses a try/catch statement to make sure the dates are valid.</p>

<!-- ************************* 11-13 ******************************* -->
<h2 id="LP7">Chapter 11-13 | Lab Project 7 | Exercise 11-1; 12-1, 12-2; 13-1</h2>

<h3>Chapter 11 | Exercise 11-1 <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch11_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch11_ex1/task_list.php" target="_blank">task_list.php</a></h3>
<p>How to create and use arrays I learned In Chapter 11. To store data in an array is very important in the process of creating applications. Also, PHP provides many functions to make easier to work with arrays. I applied new knowledge in Exercise 11-1 in application that allowed me to experiment with arrays.In the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch11_ex1/task_list.php" target="_blank">task_list.php</a> I added the code that displays indexes and values of the array $task_list and Sort button is displayed in case when more than one task in the list. In the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch11_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a> file I added or modified switch-case statements.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12 | Exercise 12-1 <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch12_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch12_ex1/add_item_view.php" target="_blank">add_item_view.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch12_ex1/cart_view.php" target="_blank">cart_view.php</a>   ||   Exercise 12-2 <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch12_ex2/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch12_ex2/task_list.php" target="_blank">task_list.php</a></h3>
<p>In Chapter 12 I learned how to work with cookies and sessions. A cookies helps web applications to use session tracking to track each user’s session. Usually, a session cookie expires when the user closes the browser, but also programmers can code modification and store cookie information for a much longer time. Programmers use functions to start, end or manage session cookie.</p> 
<p>In Exercise 12-1 I was able to modify and enhance the Shopping Cart application. I was modifying in the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch12_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a> file lifetime of session cookie (for one session and for 3 years) and added the code to clear all session data from memory. In the file <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch12_ex1/add_item_view.php" target="_blank">add_item_view.php</a> I just add Session ID information to be displayed in p tag. And for the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch12_ex1/cart_view.php" target="_blank">cart_view.php</a> I added p tag with Session ID and a link "End session and delete cookie".</p>
<p>In Exercise 12-2 I learned how to improve the Task List Manager application so it uses cookie sessions instead of hidden fields to store the array of tasks. In the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch12_ex2/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a> file I added session cookie for one year and setted the array of tasks to the session. For <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch12_ex2/task_list.php" target="_blank">task_list.php</a> file I simplified the code that the array of tasks do not store anymore in hidden HTML fields.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13 | Exercise 13-1 <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch13_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch13_ex1/cart_view.php" target="_blank"> cart_view.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch13_ex1/cart.php" target="_blank">cart.php</a></h3>
<p>How to create and use functions in PHP I learned in Chapter 13. This chapter walks through basic skills for working with functions, how pass arguments by value and by reference. Also, it explains how use library of functions, how to organize functions using namespaces, and how to write functions that generate other functions. Exercise 13-1 shows how to modify and enhance the Shopping Cart application. In this exercise I was able to pass arguments in the functions by value and by reference, and stored the library in a namespace. I was modified the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch13_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a>,<a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch13_ex1/cart_view.php" target="_blank"> cart_view.php</a>, and <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch13_ex1/cart.php" target="_blank">cart.php</a> files.</p>

<h2 id="LP8">Chapter 14 | Lab Project 8 | Exercise 14-1</h2><h3><a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch14_ex1/product_catalog/index.php" target="_blank">product_catalog/index.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch14_ex1/model/category.php" target="_blank">model/category.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch14_ex1/model/category.php" target="_blank">model/product.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch14_ex1/model/category.php" target="_blank">model/product_db.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch14_ex1/model/category_db.php" target="_blank">model/category_db.php</a></h3>
<p>Chapter 14 introduces an object-oriented programming. I learned how to create and use classes, constructors, methods, and objects. Also, how to work with inheritance and interfaces. In the exercise from this chapter I was modifying the Product Manager Application. In the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch14_ex1/model/category.php" target="_blank">model/category.php</a> and <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch14_ex1/model/category.php" target="_blank">model/product.php</a> I was setting methods to set data in the two objects. Alos, I have used constructors and regular methods instead of static methods in <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch14_ex1/model/category.php" target="_blank">model/product_db.php</a> and <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch14_ex1/model/category_db.php" target="_blank">model/category_db.php</a> files. In the <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch14_ex1/product_catalog/index.php" target="_blank">product_catalog/index.php</a> I was creating two new objects to retrieve data from them.</p>


<!-- ************************* 15 ******************************* -->
<h2 id="LP9">Chapter 15 | Lab Project 9 | Exercise 15-1, 15-2</h2>
<p>How to use regular expressions, handle exceptions, and validate data I was learning in Chapter 15. Also, I learned how to use throw statement that can trigger a runtime error called an exception. Try/catch statement can help to catch any exceptions that are thrown. 
<h3>Chapter 15 | Lab Project 9 | Exercise 15-1 <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch15_ex1/index.php" target="_blank">index.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch15_ex1/view/register.php" target="_blank">view/register.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch15_ex1/model/validate.php" target="_blank">model/validate.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch15_ex1/model/fields.php" target="_blank">model/fields.php</a></h3>
<p>In the Exercise 15-1 I modified the long version of the Registration application . I modified code in 4 files, so the to the form added one more field, 4 fields getting optional and email address can automatically be validated.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15 | Lab Project 9 | Exercise 15-2 <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch15_ex2/product_manager/index.php" target="_blank">product_manger/index.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch15_ex2/product_manager/product_add.php" target="_blank">product_manger/product_add.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch15_ex2/model/validate.php" target="_blank">model/validate.php</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch15_ex2/model/fields.php" target="_blank">model/fields.php</a></h3>
<p>In Exercise 15-2 I modified the Product Manager Application so it uses the validation techniques. I modified four files to make validates on numeric entries, product code, and name. Also, the product code except not more than 11 characters.</p>

<!-- ************************* 16-18 ******************************* -->
<h2 id="LP10">Chapter 16 | Lab Project 9 | Exercise <a href="../public_html/images/16_1.jpg" target="_blank">16-1</a>, <a href="../public_html/images/16_2.jpg" target="_blank">16-2</a>, <a href="../public_html/htdocs/book_apps/_create_db/customers_alter.sql" target="_blank">17-1</a>, <a href="../public_html/htdocs/book_apps/_create_db/ap.sql" target="_blank">17-2</a>, 18-1</h2><h3> <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch18_ex1/select_products.sql" target="_blank">select_products.sql</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch18_ex1/count_products_by_category.sql" target="_blank">count_products_by_category.sql</a> | <a href="../public_html/htdocs/ex_starts/ch18_ex1/insert_customer.sql

" target="_blank">delete_customer.sql</a></h3></h2>
<p>Chapter 16 introduces MySQL Workbench and explains how this application useful in a process of designing databases. Here discussed how to create database and assign permissions for each users.</p>
<p>In Exercise 16-1 I was created new diagram within new model in MySQL Workbench from the script. Also, I checked Primary keys of the tables and added Foreign keys and relationships between six tables. In Exercise 16-2 I was created small database that contain three tables: Artists, Albums, Songs. They all have Primary keys and relate to each other.</p>
<p>In Chapter 17 I learned how to use SQL to create, select, or drop  a database; how to work with tables and indexes. In addition, I was introduced to database security: how to work with users and privileges for them. 
In Exercise 17-1 I was run a script that contains some statements that alter that database. I created new script file that added middleInitials to the Customer table and modifies firstName column, so it can store up to 100 characters.
</p>
<p>In Exercise 17-2 I created a simple database Accounts Payable (AP) that contains only 3 columns. Also, I added to the script file statements to create indexes and a user, and grant this user privileges to select, insert, or update data from any table in the database.</p>
<p>How to use SQL to work with a database I learned in Chapter 18. It shows how to code SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. In addition, it shows how to use LIMIT, WHERE, ORDER BY clauses, and IS NOT NULL, LIKE operators. I learned how to select data from multiple tables; insert, update, and delete rows; how to code summary queries and subqueries. All these processes can be coded in PHP, but in some cases MySQL will improve the performance of a database application. 
In Exercise 18-1 I was able to work with the data in a database. I was running some examples from the book. There are some SELECT statements that retrieve data in different tables and columns and categorize it. Than, I was practicing with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.</p>
